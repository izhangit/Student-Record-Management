## Menu-Driven porgram that performs CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a Student database.

The program starts by asking the user to enter a number representing the operation they want to perform.

The available options are as follows:
- 1 . Insert a new student Name, Phone Number, Email and Age.
- 2 . Display all the student records from the database.
- 3 . Delete a specific student record by providing the student ID.
- 4 . Update a student's informartion by providing their ID and the new datails.
- 5 . Exit the Program.

> The Code is wrapped in a try-except block to handle any exceptions that may occur during execution.
> If an exception occurs, the program will print an error message and ask the user to try again.
